# Person Recognition

Designed and implemented Person Recognition System as Person Attendance Tracker
using face recognition methods to track and record personâ€™s identities in the videos
captured from security cameras. Achieved more than 90% tracking and recognition
accuracy in non-occluded and more than 80% in occluded areas

## Dataset:
[chokepoint dataset](http://arma.sourceforge.net/chokepoint/)

## Results:

Tested on 6 sequences of trackings and results in terms of tracking and recognition accuracy.
